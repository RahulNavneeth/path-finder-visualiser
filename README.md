<b>
Welcome to the Path Finder Visualizer! This is a web application built using SvelteKit that allows you to visualize the pathfinding algorithm in action. The current implementation uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. In the future, we plan to add support for various other pathfinding algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, A*, and more.
